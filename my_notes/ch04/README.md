## Text Encoding

>The latest version of Java bases its character and string data on the Unicode 14.0 standard, which uses at least two bytes to represent each symbol internally.

- The Java `char` type and `String` class natively support Unicode values.

## types

>The type system of a programming language describes how its data elements are associated with storage in memory and how they are related to one another.

>**Generics** are reference types that refine an existing type while still providing compile-time type safety.
