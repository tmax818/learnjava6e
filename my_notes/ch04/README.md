## Text Encoding

>The latest version of Java bases its character and string data on the Unicode 14.0 standard, which uses at least two bytes to represent each symbol internally.

- The Java `char` type and `String` class natively support Unicode values.
- [Encoding.java](./Encoding.java)

## types

>The *type system* of a programming language describes how its data elements are associated with storage in memory and how they are related to one another.

statically typed
dynamically typed

>Java combines any of the best features of both statically and dynamically typed languages. ... Java also maintains runtime information about objects and uses this to allow truly dynamic behavior. 

*casting* converting between types

*polymorphism* combining features from multiple types

- two categories of data types in Java:
  - *primitive types*
  - *reference types*

>**Generics** are reference types that refine an existing type while still providing compile-time type safety.

- [Types.java](./Types.java)

## primitive types

- primitive types are precisely defined for portability

## floating-point precision

## variables declaration and initialization

## integer literals

- [IntLit.java](./src/IntLit.java)

## floating-point literals

- double is more precises than float

## character literals

- [CharLit.java](./src/CharLit.java)
